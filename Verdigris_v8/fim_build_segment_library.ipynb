    "The first step to create a FLDPLN library is to identify stream networks and create stream segments from a hydro-conditioned digital elevation model (DEM). The stream networks/pixels are first identified using a flow accumulation threshold ('strthr'). The stream networks are first divided into reaches (stream links in ArcGIS term), which are stream segments between headwater and confluence pixels or between two consecutive confluence pixels. Note that pixels flow out of the DEM are treated as confluence pixels in this process. Those natural reaches/segments are further divided based on flow accumulation jumps greater than or equal to 'facthr'. Then the segments are bisected until all segments are no longer than 'seglen'.\n",

Note that Kansas FLDPLN libraries stream networks are more coarse grained than the National Water Model (NWM) reaches. This is because the stream networks are generated just to use available USGS gauges. If the NWM discharge is used for the flood inundation mapping, the stream networks need to be densified.\n",
